# Review Code and Update README Files

## Overview
Systematically review all code implementations across project folders and update corresponding README files to ensure all changes are properly documented while preserving accurate existing content.

## Steps
1. **Analyze pages folder**

   - Preserve valid existing documentation

2. **Analyze stores folder**
   - Review state management implementations
   - Identify new stores and state logic
   - Note modified store patterns
   - Update @_stores-README.md with changes
   - Preserve accurate state flow descriptions

3. **Analyze services folder**
   - Review API and utility service implementations
   - Identify new service endpoints and utilities
   - Note modified service logic
   - Update @_services-README.md with changes
   - Preserve valid service descriptions

4. **Analyze lib folder**
   - Review utility function implementations
   - Identify new utility functions
   - Note modified helper functions
   - Update @_lib-README.md with changes
   - Preserve accurate utility documentation

5. **Analyze components folder**
   - Review component implementations
   - Identify new components and their props
   - Note modified component interfaces
   - Update @_components-README.md with changes
   - Preserve valid component documentation

6. **Analyze documents folder**
   - Review document processing implementations
   - Identify new document features
   - Note modified document handling
   - Update @_documents-README.md with changes
   - Preserve relevant content

7. **Analyze hooks folder**
   - Review custom hook implementations
   - Identify new hooks and dependencies
   - Note modified hook logic
   - Update @_hooks-README.md with changes
   - Preserve valid hook documentation

8. **Analyze types folder**
   - Review TypeScript type definitions
   - Identify new types and interfaces
   - Note modified type definitions
   - Update @_types-README.md with changes
   - Preserve accurate type documentation

9. **Update main README**
   - Review architecture changes
   - Update project overview if needed
   - Document new major features
   - Preserve accurate existing content
   - Ensure consistency across all READMEs

## Documentation Guidelines

**What to ADD:**
- New components, functions, or features
- New API endpoints or services
- New types or interfaces
- New hooks or utilities
- New routing patterns

**What to UPDATE:**
- Changed functionality or logic
- Modified interfaces or props
- Updated dependencies
- Altered data flow patterns
- Changed architectural decisions

**What to PRESERVE:**
- Accurate existing descriptions
- Valid usage examples
- Correct interface definitions
- Current best practices
- Relevant implementation notes

**What to REMOVE:**
- Outdated functionality descriptions
- Obsolete code references
- Incorrect implementation details
- Deprecated patterns
- Redundant information

## Consistency Standards
- Maintain uniform formatting across all READMEs
- Use consistent section headers and structure
- Apply same tone and clarity level
- Follow established documentation patterns
- Keep examples and code snippets consistent

## Review Scope
**ONLY document code that:**
- Was implemented in this session
- Has been modified recently
- Is new and undocumented
- Has incorrect or outdated documentation

**DO NOT rewrite:**
- Sections that are already accurate
- Valid existing documentation
- Correct implementation details
- Up-to-date usage examples
