# Create Multi-Component System Documentation

## Overview
Generate unified README.md that explains how multiple codebases/systems work together, serving both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Steps
1. **Analyze system components**
   - Review each component's purpose and functionality
   - Map relationships and dependencies between components
   - Identify integration points and data flow patterns
   - Document overall system architecture

2. **Create executive summary**
   - Write jargon-free explanation of system purpose
   - Define key business value and use cases
   - Identify target audiences for documentation
   - Summarize primary user workflows

3. **Document component breakdown**
   - Explain each component's business purpose
   - Detail technical role in system architecture
   - List key features and functionality
   - Map interfaces and connections to other components
   - Describe data types handled

4. **Map system interactions**
   - Document component communication methods
   - Illustrate data flow patterns
   - Define dependency relationships
   - Outline integration workflows

5. **Provide setup and usage guides**
   - Create user access and navigation instructions
   - Document common workflows for users
   - Provide developer setup and key file locations
   - Include testing and debugging procedures

6. **Add technical reference**
   - List technology stack and requirements
   - Document APIs and configuration options
   - Provide troubleshooting guide
   - Link to external resources and dependencies

## Documentation Checklist
- [ ] System overview with business context
- [ ] Each component documented with purpose
- [ ] Component relationships mapped
- [ ] Data flow patterns illustrated
- [ ] Integration points identified
- [ ] Quick start guide for users
- [ ] Quick start guide for developers
- [ ] Technical stack documented
- [ ] Configuration options listed
- [ ] Troubleshooting section included
