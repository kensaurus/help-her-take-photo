# Create Project Handoff Documentation

## Overview
Generate comprehensive handoff documentation package for seamless knowledge transfer to new team members or stakeholders.

## Steps
1. **Project overview and status**
   - Document project description and business purpose
   - Record current completion status and milestones
   - List key objectives and stakeholders
   - Summarize technical architecture and stack

2. **Code changes inventory**
   - Catalog all new files created with purposes
   - List modified files with change rationales
   - Document dependencies added/updated
   - Map file relationships and dependencies

3. **Development status assessment**
   - Detail completed features and acceptance criteria
   - Document in-progress work with remaining tasks
   - List pending backlog items with priorities
   - Identify technical debt and known issues

4. **Quality and deployment documentation**
   - Document testing coverage and results
   - List security considerations and configurations
   - Provide environment setup instructions
   - Detail deployment process and requirements

5. **Future roadmap and resources**
   - Outline immediate next steps
   - Document short-term and long-term goals
   - Provide key code locations and documentation links
   - List team contacts and subject matter experts
